## Open Ai project

## Running the project

- Create `.env` file. add `MONGODB_ATLAS_URI` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

run,

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

server should be running at: `http://localhost:3000/`

example request: `http://localhost:3000/test?prompt="what's the meaning of life"`

I have reached my OpenAi api limit so i couldn't test it properly. Please let me know if there's is any problem.
